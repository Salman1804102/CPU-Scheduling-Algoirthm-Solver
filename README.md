# CPU-Scheduling-Algoirthm-Solver
3RD YEAR UNiVERSiTY OPERATiNG SYSTEM TEAM PROJECT 

***• Tools:*** C++, STL, CPU Scheduling Algorithm, CodeBlocks.<br>• Implemented various CPU scheduling algorithm like **FCFS, Priority Preemptive and Non Preemptive, Round Robin, SJF,  SRTF and a Proposed CPU Scheduling Algorithm**<br>• Implemented the algorithm in CodeBlock’s Console input, output.<br>• Has the Comparing Facility between different algorithms for same input<br>• We also proposed an algorithm titled by *"A comparative analysis of CPU Scheduling Algorithm with a proposed SRTF like CPU Scheduler by Modifying the Time Quantum of Round Robin Algorithm"*
