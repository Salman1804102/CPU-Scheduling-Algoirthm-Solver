# CPU-Scheduling-Algoirthm-Solver
3RD YEAR UNiVERSiTY OPERATiNG SYSTEM TEAM PROJECT 

• Tools: C++, STL, CPU Scheduling Algorithm, CodeBlocks.
• Implemented various CPU scheduling algorithm like FCFS, Priority Preemptive and Non Preemptive, Round Robin, SJF, SRTF and a Proposed CPU Scheduling Algorithm
• Implemented the algorithm in CodeBlock’s Console input, output.
• Has the Comparing Facility between different algorithms for same input
• We also proposed an algorithm titled by "A comparative analysis of CPU Scheduling Algorithm with a proposed SRTF like CPU Scheduler by Modifying the Time Quantum of Round Robin Algorithm"
